Our name comes from an inside joke that a great sandwich is not only delicious, but also has integrity, staying together from first bite to the last, but that is the joke that got us here. \n\nUltimately we are a few friends who all have our own interests in having a food blog, so here we are. \n\nWe plan to cover the full range: from food trucks to Michelin star establishments; home made recipes; all variety of drinks; home made recipes; and anything else we happen to do. \n\nWe hope you enjoy!",
